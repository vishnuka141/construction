              <p>Throughout our years in business, we've accumulated a strong expertise both in managing and completing any type of a construction, as well as in choosing the <br> right vendors and sub-contractors... We understand how vital it is to coordinate the <br>project in a timely, cost-efficient way. As of now we've alreeady dealt with numerous <br>mid and large scale constructions, so we've mastered the art of minimizing the extra expenses, completing each project's stage on schedule and implementing a live <br> project intact with both original engineering solutions and the client's initial vision...</p>

              </span>
              <p> As you may know, the construction planning process has always been far from perfect... In the past, project schedules were unrealistically optimistic... That resulted in an average of 45% of work promised in a week actually being completed at a later date than its deadline dictated. This kind of protraction left subcontractors waiting for the previous task to be completed, even before the next stage of work could have proceeded further... To fix that issue, our construction bureau have implemented the Pull Planning process, coordinated with the trade contractors on a weekly basis. Pull Planning method estimates the scheduling in reverse.
